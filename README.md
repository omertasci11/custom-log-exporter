# Custom Log Exporter Windows Event Viewer

We get the failed rdp logs (EventID=4625) in the security section with the help of the while loop and then we get geolocation information by sending the IP information obtained from these logs to the 3rd party API (https://ipgeolocation.io/). We write all this information in a log file that we have created in the appropriate log format.
